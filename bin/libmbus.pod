=head1 NAME

libmbus (utilities) - support utilities to the libmbus. libmbus is an open
source M-bus (Meter-Bus) library. The Meter-Bus is a standard for reading out
meter data from electricity meters, heat meters, gas meters, etc. The role
of the libmbus library is to decode/encode M-bus data, and to handle 
the communication with M-Bus devices.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<mbus-serial-switch-baudrate> - attempts to switch the communication speed of
the MBus device.

B<mbus-serial-scan>, B<mbus-tcp-scan> - sequentially scan for devices on MBus bus
using primary addresses.

B<mbus-serial-scan-secondary>, B<mbus-tcp-scan-secondary>  - scan for devices on
MBus bus using secondary addresses. The scan is not sequential.

B<mbus-serial-request-data>, B<mbus-tcp-request-data> - read data from given device.
Supports both primary and secondary address types.

B<mbus-serial-request-data-multi-reply>, B<mbus-tcp-request-data-multi-reply> - read
data from given device supporting multi-telegram (default: up to 16 frames) reply. 
Can be also used for single telegram as mbus-serial-request-data or mbus-tcp-request-data.
Supports both primary and secondary address types.

B<mbus-serial-select-secondary>, B<mbus-tcp-select-secondary> - perform single secondary
address select to check what device responds.

B<mbus-tcp-raw-send> - send a single raw hex frame to a MBus device.

=head1 OPTIONS

There are following options/parameters:

=over 4

=item B<-b> I<BAUDRATE>

For serial communication, use given I<BAUDRATE> (integer in Bd). If not used then
default baudrate of 9600 will be used.
libmbus supports following baud rates: 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200,
38400.
Note that your MBus gateway and/or MBus device will most likely support only
a subset of these. The most commonlu used/supported rates are probably 9600, 2400
and 300.

=item B<-r> I<RETRIES>

Maximum retransmissions. In case a MBus device doesn't reply to a request or
the response is erroneous, the MBus master can send a retransmissions.

libmbus supports the following range of retransmission: 0 until 9

=item B<-f> I<FRAMES>

Maximum response frames. 

=item B<-d>

Enable debugging messages.

=item B<device>

For serial communication, the serial device which represents the MBus (gateway).
Typically something like /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyUSB0, etc.

=item B<host>

For TCP communciation, the host which represents the MBus (gateway).

=item B<port>

For TCP communciation, the port on the host which represents the MBus (gateway).
An integer between 0 and 65535.

=item B<address>

MBus device primary address. An integer between 1 and 250.

=item B<address-mask>

Address mask for secondary address scan - you can restrict the search by supplying
an optional address mask on the form 'FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF' where F is a wildcard
character.

=item B<mbus-address>

MBus device address. Could be a primary address or a secondary address (sixteen
digit hexadecimal number).

The primary address should be an integer between 1 and 250 for addressing
individual devices. However the program does allow using any one byte number (i.e.
0 to 255) so that you can also use addresses reserved for physical or data link
layers management, secondary addressing, broadcasts, etc.

=item B<secondary-mbus-address>

MBus secondary address of the device. Sixteen digit hexadecimal number.

=item B<target-baudrate>

For serial communication, the baudrate to which the device should be switched.

=item B<file>

Path to an file with hex values. 

=back


=head1 EXAMPLES

Scan for MBus devices on the serial port:

  mbus-serial-scan -d -b 2400 /dev/ttyS0

Try to switch baud rate of a device on address 59 from 2400Bd to 9600Bd:

  mbus-serial-switch-baudrate -b 2400 /dev/ttyUSB0 59 9600

Readout a MBus device on address 59 at 2400Bd:

  mbus-serial-request-data-multi-reply -b 2400 /dev/ttyS0 59
